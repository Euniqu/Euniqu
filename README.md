- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Eunique


- With six years in journalism, I've honed my skills in storytelling, research, and effective communication. 
  My journey in journalism allowed me to unearth stories, investigate complex issues, and craft narratives that resonated with diverse audiences.
  Transitioning into software development, I've brought this narrative-driven mindset to code. As a software developer, 
  I leverage my journalistic curiosity to dissect problems, engineer innovative solutions, and create user-centric projects. Proficient in languages like Python ,Java and Web Development
  I merge the art of storytelling with the precision of code to develop robust and intuitive software.
  My hybrid background empowers me to bridge the gap between technology and human stories, ensuring that the projects i work on are not just functional but also engaging and impactful.
